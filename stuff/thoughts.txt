login page (bootstrap)
redirects to a different page with buttons in the middle with text (that redirect to a different page)
display information of employee by ID to get all lines of data
    this would work with the different start and end dates
one button for inputting employee data
    can input employee information like the login page
    then adds information to txt file (payout will start as N/A)
second button to calculate payroll
    needs ID and start and end dates 
    checks if ID is  
    will tell you if payroll is already calculated
        if so, then no changes are made
    then adds it to txt file
third button
    display information of employee by ID to get all lines of data
    needs an input of ID
    will display formatted information
        most likely name as header then pay with dates
Need two extra buttons
    one always shown to logout and redirects to login page
    second one needs to be shown after pressing the 3 major button to go back to said buttons
